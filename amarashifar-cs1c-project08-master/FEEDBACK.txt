FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done this quarter!


Excellent description of findings in GraphsandCommentation.pdf file.

Quicksort does not perform well with small array sizes. Recall that 
   calculating the median of three also has high overhead. 
 
   Did you try taking a closer look at your results when filtering out 
   the outlier runtime for array size of 20000?
   
	Yes, the oscillation of run times is most likely due to background applications, 
	processes etc. For example, a spike could be due to GC running in the background. 
	Perhaps a Java profiler (such as JProfiler) would help solve the mystery. 

   
   
+1 Well done in taking the average of three runs for each combination
   of recursion limit and array size!
